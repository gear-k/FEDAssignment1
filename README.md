## Project Overview
Entr is an elegant and modern fashion website designed to provide fashion enthusiasts with the latest trends, clothing collections, and style inspiration. Our platform aims to make online shopping a delightful experience, offering a wide range of clothing, accessories, and fashion-related content.

## Design Process
Entr is created with fashion-forward users in mind, who want to explore and shop for the latest fashion items. Our design process focused on the following user stories:

- As a fashion-conscious user, I want to browse the latest fashion collections.
- As a shopper, I want to easily find and purchase fashionable clothing and accessories.
- As a style enthusiast, I want to discover fashion tips and trends through engaging content.

We started with wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and user experience. You can view our design concepts in the [Adobe XD wireframe](link-to-xd-file).
