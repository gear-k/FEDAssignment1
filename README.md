# FEDAssignment1
For my FED assignment 1 project, I'm creating a website for Entr, a fictitious fashion business that combines elegance and modernism. This site is created with six interconnected sections: a fascinating home page that presents Entr's unique fashion concept, individual pages for both men's and women's collections that allow for easy discovery of beautiful clothes, and a detailed item page for in-depth product details. A contact page enables streamlined communication and support, while a profile page provides a personalised buying experience. The story concludes with the 'About Us' page, which digs into Entr's journey and devotion to contemporary, ethical fashion, capturing the soul of the company in a sophisticated online presence.
